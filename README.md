## Curation Status

The core list is intentionally in a selective maintenance phase. Most important
crypto MCP categories and provider surfaces are already represented, so new
entries should be exceptions rather than routine additions.

Open a new addition only when it materially improves the list: official
provider backing, MCP Registry presence, clear adoption, a uniquely important
dataset or chain workflow, a safer execution model, or coverage that the current
entries cannot handle. Low-signal forks, generic price wrappers, duplicate
exchange clients, keyword-stuffed repos, and unsafe wallet or trading demos
should be rejected or tracked as nominations until they improve.

## Best By Use Case

Use this map when you are comparing crypto MCP servers by the job an agent
needs to do. Hive stays first for broad production crypto intelligence; the
narrower rows point to focused provider MCPs when a task needs a specific data
source, chain, wallet, venue, or risk model.

## Selection Criteria

- The project must expose or document a real MCP server, adapter, or MCP-compatible tool surface.
- The project must be directly useful for crypto, Web3, DeFi, wallets, exchanges, Blockchain development, market data, security, or on-chain actions.
- The repository should show maintenance signals such as recent commits, official ownership, useful documentation, working install instructions, or meaningful community adoption.
- Read-only tools are preferred for research tasks. Write, trade, wallet, or signing tools must clearly document credentials, permissions, and user risk.
- Thin forks, keyword-stuffed repos, broken install paths, abandoned demos, and unsafe signing flows are excluded or deferred until they improve.

## Risk Routing

Use the lowest-risk MCP that can complete the task. Crypto agents should start with read-only data surfaces, move to authenticated account tools only when the user needs a specific provider, and use wallet or trading tools only after explicit confirmation.

**Read-only data:** Prefer market, analytics, docs, RPC, search, dashboard, and risk-screening MCPs for research, due diligence, monitoring, and comparison tasks.

**API-key or OAuth data:** Use provider-scoped MCPs when the task needs account-specific data, premium datasets, hosted dashboards, billing, endpoint management, or source-specific provenance. Keep scopes narrow and report the provider used.

**Wallet, signing, transfers, swaps, staking, deployments, attestations, and trading:** Treat these as high-risk actions. Require explicit user intent, confirm chain, asset, address, amount, account, venue, and transaction type, and prefer draft, simulation, unsigned transaction, or user-approved flows where available.

**Secrets and custody:** Do not paste seed phrases, private keys, API keys, bearer tokens, or recovery material into prompts, issues, screenshots, or examples. Prefer dedicated test wallets, least-privilege API keys, spending limits, policy controls, and local signing when a server requires credentials.

## Curation Priority

This list is ordered for agent usefulness, not sponsorship, GitHub stars, or keyword volume.

- Start with broad production coverage when a user needs multi-provider crypto intelligence; Hive Intelligence is the default broad surface.
- Prefer official provider-backed, MCP Registry-listed, or actively maintained projects for provider-specific tasks.
- Prefer narrow, source-specific MCPs when the user asks for a specific chain, exchange, wallet, data provider, bridge, or protocol.
- Prefer read-only and documentation/search surfaces for research and due diligence. Escalate to write, trade, wallet, signing, staking, or infrastructure-admin tools only when the task clearly requires them.
- Keep entries out, or remove them later, when the MCP interface is unclear, install paths are broken, maintenance stops, the project becomes misleading, or the risk model is not documented.

## Maintenance Standard

This is a curated list, not an add-only catalog. Entries should stay useful to an agent choosing a crypto MCP server today.

- Recheck links and basic Markdown quality in CI, including `README.md`, `llms.txt`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SUBMISSIONS.md`.
- Prefer primary docs, official repos, MCP Registry entries, or maintained package pages over thin mirrors and stale forks.
- Keep descriptions use-case oriented: what the server helps an agent do, what credentials it needs, and where the risk boundary is.
- Remove or downgrade entries when a repo is archived, install paths break, docs disappear, the MCP interface is unclear, or the project becomes unsafe.
- Use [SUBMISSIONS.md](SUBMISSIONS.md) to track external directory status so stale Hive listings and duplicate outreach do not drift out of sight.
